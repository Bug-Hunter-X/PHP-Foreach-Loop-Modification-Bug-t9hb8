This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in PHP involving the modification of an array while iterating over it using a foreach loop.  The bug occurs because unsetting an element during iteration changes the internal pointer of the foreach loop, leading to elements being skipped. The solution demonstrates a correct way to handle this situation by first identifying the elements to remove and then removing them in a separate step.
